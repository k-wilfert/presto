Issue: Adding support for JDBC catalog to Presto Iceberg

News:
Given this help to working on by Zach:
Hmm I don't think I have a good PR to help you here.
However, I to get an idea of what you need to do, start by looking at the IcebergRestCatalogFactory class.
Essentially, you need to copy what this class does, except replace RestCatalog instances with JdbcCatalog types
The JdbcCatalog type comes from the org.apache.iceberg.jdbc package which is a third-party dependency

What has been done:
Made file: IcebergJdbcCatalogFractory.java
Location:

Added thing to the pom.xml file in iceberg:
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.iceberg</groupId>
    <artifactId>iceberg-jdbc</artifactId>
    <version>${iceberg.version}</version>
</dependency>

ensure that presto-iceberg includes the Iceberg JDBC dependency.
